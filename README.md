# REAL-TIME-MOTION-DETECTION-USING-PYHTON
Real-time visual tracking of a dynamic object present in a given video is done
to check the output via code follow these steps:
For the code to run properly we need to do the following things
The code takes time equal to video to show complete output
1. The code is made using python 3.7.4 so we require to download python 3.7.4 64 bit
2. To run and edit code we can use pycharm or directly run via python terminal
3. The module matplotlib should be installed in the python. If it is not installed, then open command prompt write pip install matplotlib or download it from matplotlib website manually
4. add numpy using code     python -m pip install numpy 
                            python -m pip install scipy 
5. add open cv using code python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
6. The video and the code must be kept in the same folder.
7. THe code is made for using 3 videos but any video is used by renaming it to the used video or editing code little
6. The output will video containing box with moving objects
7. To understand the code, comments are specified in order to help the reader have the better understanding of the code.


STEP to follow to see output:
1. run code
2. enter the number 1 or 2 or 3 this will run video no 1 or 2 or3 respectively
3. click on the newly appeared icon that contain video
4. to stop video and code cancel the terminal containing code and this make video also to stop OR PRESS ESC
